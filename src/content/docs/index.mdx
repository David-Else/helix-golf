import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<CardGrid stagger>
<Card title="Object into Array">

**Before**

```js
const palette = {
	apricot: "#f47868",
	lightning: "#ffcd1c",
	delta: "6f44f0",
};
```

<details>

<summary>
`mr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`
</summary>

1. Go inside of the object
1. `mr{[` to replace the surrounding `{` with `[`
1. `mi[` to select inside the entire array
1. `s` to enter select mode
1. `:` + `Enter` will place a cursor on every `:`
1. `r,` replaces each selection with a `,`
1. `t,` moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma
1. `;` collapses the selection around each cursor into a single selection
1. `vgs` selects each line excluding the final comma
1. `ms[` surrounds each individual selection with `[` to turn it into an array
1. `l` moves 1 character forward, replacing the selection with just a 1-width selection
1. `e` selects until the end of each word
1. `ms"` surrounds the items with double quotes to make strings

</details>

**After**

```js
const palette = [
	["apricot", "#f47868"],
	["lightning", "#fccd1c"],
	["delta", "6f44f0"],
];
```
