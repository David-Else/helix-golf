*For all examples, we'll assume that your cursor is on the very first character*

#### Object into Array

##### Before

```js
const palette = {
	apricot: "#f47868",
	lightning: "#ffcd1c",
	delta: "6f44f0",
};
```

##### After

```js
const palette = [
	["apricot", "#f47868"],
	["lightning", "#fccd1c"],
	["delta", "6f44f0"],
];
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
`mr{[mi[s:<enter>r,t,;vgsms[lems"`
</summary>

1. Go inside of the object with `j`
1. `mr{[` to replace the surrounding `{` with `[`
1. `mi[` to select inside the entire array
1. `s` to enter select mode
1. `:` + `Enter` will place a cursor on every `:`
1. `r,` replaces each selection with a `,`
1. `t,` moves the cursor on each line to the ending comma
1. `;` collapses the selection around each cursor into a single selection
1. `vgs` selects each line excluding the final comma
1. `ms[` surrounds each individual selection with `[` to turn it into an array
1. `l` moves 1 character forward, replacing the selection with just a 1-width selection
1. `e` selects until the end of each word
1. `ms"` surrounds the items with double quotes to make strings

</details>

#### CSV to SQL

##### Before

```csv
id 1,Item 1,cost 1,location 1
id 2,Item 2,cost 2,location 2
id 10,Item 10,cost 10,location 10
```

##### After

```sql
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 1','Item 1','Cost 1','Location 1'); 
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 2','Item 2','Cost 2','Location 2');
INSERT INTO `database`.`table` (`id` ,`item` ,`cost` ,`location`) VALUES ('id 10','Item 10','Cost 10','Location 10');
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
```%s\n<enter>"yys\d<enter>dhhbms``xms(IINSERT INTO `database<esc>a.`table<esc>la <esc>AVALUES (<esc>"ypS,ms'A;<esc>Fl;~```
</summary>

1. `%` selects full file
1. `s\n` then `Enter` split selection into multiple selections on newline
1. `"yy` yanks the 10 selections into "y" register
1. `s\d` then `Enter` selects all digits
1. `d` delete the selected digits
1. `hh` goes backwards 2 chars, important to make sure we are at the end of each word
1. `b` selects till the beginning of every word
1. `ms` ` surrounds each word with a backtick
1. ` ` ` switches all characters to lowercase
1. `x` selects each line then `_` trims the trailing whitespace
1. `ms(` surrounds each line with parentheses
1. `I` goes into insert mode at the beginning of each line
1. Type the following:

		```
		INSERT INTO `database
		```

1. `Escape` goes back to normal mode
1. `a` to go into insert mode after the backtick then type:

		```
		.`table
		```
1. `Escape` goes back into normal mode, then `la` to enter insert mode just before the opening parentheses
1. Add a `Space` then `Escape` to go back into normal mode again
1. `A` goes into insert mode at the end of each line, now type:

		```
		VALUES (
		```

1. Hit `Escape` to leave insert mode. Your cursor will be at the closing parenthesis. 
1. `"yp` pastes our previously yanked items from the "y" register
1. `S,` splits current selection into multiple selections on each comma
1. `ms'` surrounds each item with a single quote
1. `A;` adds a semicolon at the end of each line
1. `Escape` goes back to normal mode and `Fl` to place your cursor on the lowercase "l" of each "location"
1. `;` collapses each selection into a single-width selection
1. `~` toggles the case for each "l" into "L"

#### Convert functions into a class

##### Before

```py
def calculate_area(length, width):
	result = length * width
	return result

def calculate_perimiter(length, width):
	result = 2 * (length + width)
	return result

def calculate_volume(length, width, height):
	result = length * width * height
	return result
```

##### After

```py
class Calculator
	@staticmethod
	def get_area(len, wid):
		return len * wid

	@staticmethod
	def get_perimiter(len, wid):
		return 2 * (len + wid)

	@staticmethod
	def get_volume(len, wid, hei):
		return len * wid * hei
```

##### Command

<details>

<summary>
``%scalculate<enter>cget<esc>O@staticmethod<esc>jxxs\w+<enter>slength|width|height<enter>bllled%sresult =<enter>C<alt-(>;ddss<enter>xd%>O<backspace>class Calculator:``
</summary>

1. `%` selects the entire file
1. `s` and then input `calculate` then hit `Enter` to make a selection on all instances of the word
1. `c` then type `get` to change each selection
1. `Escape` to go back to normal mode
1. `O` creates an empty line above each cursor, write:

		```
		@staticmethod
		```

1. Hit `Esc` and then select the function definitions as well as the first line of each function with `j` followed by `xx`
1. `s` then type `\w+` to select "one or more (+) wordly character (\\w)" which translates to "select each word" followed by `Enter`
1. `s` again then type `length|width|height` followed by `Enter` to select those words
1. `b` followed by `lll` moves to the 4th letter of each word
1. `e` selects until the end of each word and `d` deletes it
1. select the entire file again with `%` followed by `s` to bring up selection prompt again
1. Write `result =` followed by `Enter` to select all instances of that string
1. `C` to duplicate each selection on the next line
1. Use `Alt` + `(` to rotate the *contents* of the selection backward
1. `;` collapses each cursor into a single selection
1. `dd` deletes two characters on each of the 6 lines
1. `s` to bring up the prompt, then input `s` followed by `Enter` to select all "s" characters
1. Select each of the lines with `x` followed by `d` to delete
1. Select whole file with `%` and indent with `>`
1. `O` creates a newline above and enters Insert mode, then `Backspace` to delete an extra tab
1. Write this:

		```
		class Calculator:
		```
